# Decision Log

Status values: `proposed`, `accepted`, `superseded`.

## D-001 · M1–M4 are slots, not contracts

- **Status:** accepted
- **Date:** 2026-10-17
- **Context:** The Bloomberg bulk export contains generic nearby ranks. On every
  roll date all four ranks shift by one contract; the front contract disappears
  from the panel.
- **Decision:** Build a lossless contract-level panel from
  `FUT_CUR_GEN_TICKER`. Compute returns within a contract and map them back to
  ranks. Never difference generic prices across a roll.
- **Consequences:** Roll-day returns use the new contract's previous-day price
  (old next rank). Naive generic returns are kept only as a diagnostic.

## D-002 · Pair eligibility: no delivery month + D=10 trading days

- **Status:** accepted
- **Date:** 2026-10-17
- **Context:** The data's generic roll date is Bloomberg's convention, not the
  exchange last trading day. For grains, softs, and metals, M1 rolls inside the
  delivery month. Holding into delivery is not acceptable for a financial
  backtest.
- **Decision:** A contract is eligible only if:
  1. the date is at least 5 trading days before the delivery-month start; and
  2. `days_to_last_trading > D`, with `D = 10` for main results.
  `D = 5` and `D = 20` are robustness checks.
- **Consequences:** Pairs are mostly M1–M2, shifting to M2–M3 near the generic
  roll. The pair rank mix is reported in QA. The rule is a proxy for first
  notice/last trading, not an exchange calendar.

## D-003 · Dollar spread primary, log spread reference

- **Status:** accepted
- **Date:** 2026-10-17
- **Context:** A 1:1 calendar spread's P&L is `multiplier × Δ(P_T1 - P_T2)`.
  Ratio/log spreads are scale-free but not the traded price.
- **Decision:** `spread_dollar` is the primary trading/P&L measure.
  `spread_log` is stored and used as a reference/signal measure. Log spread is
  valid only when both prices are positive.
- **Consequences:** Cross-commodity comparisons may use log/percentage
  normalization; the backtest still executes dollar spread.

## D-004 · Liquidity threshold deferred

- **Status:** accepted
- **Date:** 2026-10-17
- **Context:** A 5,000-contract threshold leaves about 19 commodities recently,
  fewer historically; M2–M3 liquidity is materially thinner than M1–M2.
- **Decision:** Build liquidity metrics and diagnostic plots first. Do not
  hard-code a universe filter. Thresholds 1k/5k/10k/20k are computed as
  booleans; the user chooses the final threshold after reviewing the plots.
- **Consequences:** `universe` tables carry threshold columns; notebooks do not
  filter unless an explicit threshold is passed.

## D-005 · Public repository excludes licensed data and papers

- **Status:** accepted
- **Date:** 2026-10-17
- **Context:** The GitHub repository is public. Bloomberg data is licensed;
  paper PDFs and course material have copyright constraints.
- **Decision:** Do not commit raw CSV/XLSX, paper PDFs, `Project.pdf`,
  `calendar-spread-brief.html`, processed parquet, or row-level extracts.
  Commit code, notebooks, docs, metadata, logs, and tests. `data/raw/README.md`
  documents filenames, checksums, and private acquisition.
- **Consequences:** Teammates need the raw CSV through a private channel; tests
  use synthetic fixtures; executed notebooks carry only aggregate/selected
  outputs.

## D-006 · Notebooks are narrative; logic lives in src

- **Status:** accepted
- **Date:** 2026-10-17
- **Context:** The final deliverable must be readable and reproducible.
- **Decision:** `notebooks/00_data_audit.ipynb` and
  `notebooks/01_panel_build.ipynb` contain short markdown narrative and short
  code cells that call `src/*.py`. No long transformations or million-row
  prints in notebooks. Processed parquet is generated, not committed.
- **Consequences:** All reusable logic is testable and importable; notebooks
  can be read without reading every implementation detail.

## D-007 · Agent log protocol

- **Status:** accepted
- **Date:** 2026-10-17
- **Context:** Two collaborators and their coding agents need a durable record
  of what changed and why, beyond git diffs.
- **Decision:** Maintain `docs/logs/AGENT_LOG.md` (append-only) and
  `docs/logs/INDEX.md`. Every material change gets an entry with ID, actions,
  files, commands, reason, validation, commit subject, and next step. Entries
  are committed with the change; commit messages reference the log ID.
- **Consequences:** Read `INDEX.md` and recent entries before work; append and
  index after work; never rewrite committed entries.

## D-008 · One common tradable spread for comparability

- **Status:** accepted
- **Date:** 2026-10-17
- **Context:** The project compares several signal families. If each idea uses
  a different pair definition, the comparison is not apples-to-apples.
- **Decision:** Main experiments use one common pair rule (nearest two eligible
  contracts, D=10, no delivery month) and one common dollar spread. Different
  ideas change the signal and holding period, not the spread definition.
  Adjacent pairs are built for robustness/alternative analysis; log/ratio
  representations are transformations, not different trades.
- **Consequences:** A/B/C/D/H are comparable at the instrument level; any
  per-idea pair change must be documented as a separate robustness experiment.
