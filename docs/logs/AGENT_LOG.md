Append-only. See `README.md` for the protocol and `_template.md` for the format.

## LOG-0001 · 2026-10-17 15:30 · Phase 0 · Claude Code

**Goal:** Understand the raw Bloomberg extract and decide the data-cleaning and
research-panel design before writing any code.

**Actions:**
- Inspected project files and the Excel metadata sheets (`START_HERE`,
  `Tickers_For_Wizard`, `Universe_Details`, `Optional_Extras`,
  `Historical_Coverage`).
- Parsed the wide CSV into a long `date × commodity × rank` audit table.
- Checked date coverage, missing sentinels, contract-code formats, rank
  ordering, roll synchronization, contract lifecycles, price anomalies, stale
  runs, volume/OI missingness, and liquidity.
- Compared sampled Excel and CSV cells (60 rows × 385 columns; only date
  formatting differed).
- Tested `D=5/10/20` pair-selection mixes using the last observed date as the
  expiry proxy.

**Files changed:** none (read-only audit).

**Commands:**
- `python3` scripts that read the CSV/XLSX and print audit summaries.
- `git ls-remote` / `gh repo view` to inspect the empty public GitHub repo.

**Why:** To determine whether the proposed research panel could be built from
the raw extract and where the real data risks are.

**Validation / key findings:**
- 24 commodities, 96 generic series, 10,640 weekdays (1986-01-01 to
  2026-10-13); 128 all-blank US holidays.
- 6,735 real contracts; 950,626 contract-date observations; 0 duplicate
  contract-date; max gap ≤7 calendar days.
- 6,639 full-queue roll dates / 26,562 single-rank roll events; all four ranks
  shift together on every roll date; 0 partial rolls; each contract's rank is
  monotonic 4→3→2→1.
- Naive M1 returns on roll dates are contaminated: median absolute return on
  roll vs non-roll days is e.g. corn 2.97% vs 0.85%, live hogs 7.00% vs 0.80%,
  oats 4.24% vs 1.10%, WTI 1.84% vs 1.22%.
- Negative settlement only: CL 2020-04-20 = -37.63. No zero prices.
- 583 rows have settle but no contract code, mostly holidays/outages
  (2001-09-11, day after Thanksgiving, Columbus Day); discard from alignment.
- Volume/OI missing: ~16–20% overall, ~4% after 2000, much worse in 1986–1990.
- Stale runs: M1 max 4 sessions; M4 max 14 sessions (oats/rough rice).
- Liquidity: about 19 commodities pass a 5,000-contract trailing median for
  both legs recently; M2–M3 is much thinner historically (average ~7.8 names).
- Pair mix with D=10 (without the no-delivery-month rule) ≈78% M1–M2 /
  22% M2–M3; the no-delivery-month rule will shift more days to M2–M3 for
  grains/softs.

**Commit:** none (pre-repository).

**Next:** scaffold the public repo, write the collaboration/logging protocol,
then implement the panels.

## LOG-0002 · 2026-10-17 16:23 · Phase R · Claude Code

**Goal:** Scaffold the public repository, preserve the raw data locally, and
establish the documentation and agent-log protocol before implementation.

**Actions:**
- Created `data/raw`, `data/metadata`, `data/processed`, `docs/logs`, `src`,
  `notebooks`, `tests/fixtures`, `output`.
- Moved the Bloomberg CSV/XLSX from `data/` to `data/raw/` (not deleted).
- Generated `data/metadata/commodities.csv` (24 unique commodities from
  `Universe_Details`) and `data/metadata/raw_file_checksums.txt`.
- Copied the detailed Chinese README to `docs/project_brief.md`; wrote a new
  concise `README.md`.
- Added `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `requirements.txt`, `.gitignore`.
- Added `docs/decisions.md` (D-001..D-008), `docs/data_dictionary.md`,
  `docs/onboarding.md`, and the `docs/logs/` protocol files.
- Added `data/raw/README.md`, `paper/README.md`, and `.gitkeep` placeholders.

**Files changed:**
- `README.md` — rewritten (concise Chinese entry)
- `docs/project_brief.md` — preserved detailed background
- `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.gitignore`, `requirements.txt` — new
- `docs/decisions.md`, `docs/data_dictionary.md`, `docs/onboarding.md` — new
- `docs/logs/README.md`, `docs/logs/AGENT_LOG.md`, `docs/logs/INDEX.md`,
  `docs/logs/_template.md` — new
- `data/metadata/commodities.csv`, `data/metadata/raw_file_checksums.txt` — new
- `data/raw/README.md`, `paper/README.md` — new
- `data/processed/.gitkeep`, `output/.gitkeep` — new

**Commands:**
- `mkdir -p ...`
- `mv data/*.csv data/*.xlsx data/raw/`
- `python3` (openpyxl) to generate metadata and SHA-256 checksums
- `cp README.md docs/project_brief.md`

**Why:** The GitHub repo is public. Raw Bloomberg data and paper PDFs must stay
local. A teammate and their coding agent need a concise human README, a generic
agent entry point, durable decisions, a data dictionary, and an append-only
operation log.

**Validation:**
- `data/metadata/commodities.csv` has 24 rows.
- CSV SHA-256 `045293...7771`; XLSX SHA-256 `de9b...5b42`; sizes 20MB/25MB.
- `.gitignore` excludes raw data, PDFs, parquet, and output; `data/raw/README.md`
  and `data/processed/.gitkeep` remain trackable.

**Commit:** `chore(repo): scaffold public repository and agent collaboration protocol`; follow-up `docs: add project brief, data provenance, and paper reading list`

**Next:** initialize git, add the remote, commit the scaffold/docs, push, then
start Phase 1 (loader/parser).

## LOG-0003 · 2026-10-17 16:40 · Phase 1 · Claude Code

**Goal:** Implement the raw loader, contract-code parser, and rank-panel
construction; validate on a synthetic fixture and the full raw CSV.

**Actions:**
- Added `src/config.py` with repo paths, D/K constants, liquidity thresholds,
  month codes, and the negative-price event.
- Added `src/load.py`:
  - `read_raw_wide` parses the six-header-row CSV and validates tickers/fields.
  - `parse_ticker`, `normalize_contract_code`, `parse_contract_code` handle
    spaced roots, one- and two-digit years, and `.NA.`.
  - `build_rank_panel` builds the long `date × commodity × rank` panel with
    contract identity and audit flags.
- Added `tests/fixtures/make_synthetic.py` and the generated
  `tests/fixtures/synthetic_wide.csv` (2 commodities × 4 ranks × 13 dates;
  one simultaneous roll, missing values, `.NA.`, negative price, holiday).
- Added `tests/test_contract_parsing.py` and `tests/test_roll_logic.py`.
- Installed `pytest` 9.1.1 in the active environment (was missing).

**Files changed:**
- `src/config.py` — new
- `src/load.py` — new
- `tests/fixtures/make_synthetic.py`, `tests/fixtures/synthetic_wide.csv` — new
- `tests/test_contract_parsing.py`, `tests/test_roll_logic.py` — new

**Commands:**
- `python3 tests/fixtures/make_synthetic.py`
- `python3 -m pytest -q` → 9 passed
- `python3` full-data smoke test → 1,013,664 rows × 23 columns in ~4s;
  24 roots, 10,559 union dates, 0 parse failures, 583 code-missing rows,
  1 negative price (CL 2020-04-20), 25,511 roll flags.

**Why:** Phase 1 establishes the contract identity layer. Every later panel and
return calculation depends on correct parsing and not treating M1–M4 as fixed
contracts.

**Validation:**
- Fixture panel: 96 rows, 12 dates (holiday dropped), 8 roll events, all four
  ranks roll together, 0 duplicate contract-date, one code-missing row, one
  negative price.
- Full raw: 24 roots × 4 ranks; no parse failures; `.NA.` rows flagged.
- `pytest` 9 passed.

**Commit:** `feat(load): parse Bloomberg wide export and normalize contract metadata`

**Next:** Phase 2 — contract/return panels, roll-aware returns, QA assertions.
